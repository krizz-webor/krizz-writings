## Introduction to AWS

**What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud computing is the delivery of online services (such as servers, databases, software) to users. With the help of cloud computing, storing data on local machines is not required. It helps you access data from a remote server. Moreover, it is also used to store and access data from anywhere across the world.

**What is AWS?**

Amazon web service is an online platform that provides scalable and cost-effective cloud computing solutions.

AWS is a broadly adopted cloud platform that offers several on-demand operations like compute power, database storage, content delivery, etc., to help corporates scale and grow.

**History of AWS**
* In the year 2002 - AWS services were launched
* In the year 2006- AWS cloud products were launched
* In the year 2012 - AWS had its first customer event
* In the year 2015- AWS achieved $4.6 billion
* In the year 2016- Surpassed the $10 billion revenue target
* In the year 2016- AWS snowball and AWS snowmobile were launched
* In the year 2019- Released approximately 100 cloud services

**Applications of AWS**

AWS enables businesses to build a number of sophisticated applications. Organizations of every industry and of every size, can run every imaginable use case on AWS. Here are some of the most common applications of AWS:-

**Storage and Backup**

One of the reasons why many businesses use AWS is because it offers multiple types of storage to choose from and is easily accessible as well. It can be used for storage and file indexing as well as to run critical business applications.

**Websites**

Businesses can host their websites on the AWS cloud, similar to other web applications. 

**Gaming**

There is a lot of computing power needed to run gaming applications. AWS makes it easier to provide the best online gaming experience to gamers across the world.

**Mobile, Web and Social Applications**

A feature that separates AWS from other cloud services is its capability to launch and scale mobile, e-commerce, and SaaS applications. API-driven code on AWS can enable companies to build uncompromisingly scalable applications without requiring any OS and other systems.

**Companies using AWS**

Whether it’s technology giants, startups, government, food manufacturers or retail organizations, there are so many companies across the world using AWS to develop, deploy and host applications. According to Amazon, the number of active AWS users exceeds 1,000,000. Here is a list of companies using AWS:
* Netflix
* Intuit
* Coinbase
* Finra
* Johnson & Johnson
* Capital One
* Adobe
* Airbnb
* AOL
* Hitachi

**Advantages of AWS Services**

The power of AWS services lies in the fact that it enables businesses to reach the marketplaces with little initial investment. Here are some advantages of AWS services:

**Security**

There is a false misconception that data stored in a public cloud is not secure. On the contrary, not only does AWS offer security tools that are cheaper than other alternatives, but it is one of the most secure, extensive, and reliable cloud platforms.  

**Global Availability** 

AWS has 80 Availability Zones across 25 geographic regions global data centers. 

**Scalability and Flexibility** 

AWS offers unlimited flexibility and scalability on demand. This enables organizations to plan their infrastructure roadmap on a subscription basis without full commitment.

**Little Investment** 

AWS cloud services enable companies to save expenditures on extra software and hardware. There is no physical data required, which ultimately lowers down operating costs. 

Now, that we have understood what is AWS, advantages and application, let us know the AWS services.
AWS Services

Amazon has many services for cloud applications. Let us list down a few key services of the AWS ecosystem and a brief description of how developers use them in their business.

Amazon has a list of services:
* Compute service
* Storage
* Database
* Networking and delivery of content
* Security tools
* Developer tools
* Management tools
Compute Service

These services help developers build, deploy, and scale an application in the cloud platform.

**AWS EC2**

* It is a web service that allows developers to rent virtual machines and automatically scales the compute capacity when required.
* It offers various instance types to developers so that they can choose required resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity based on their application requirements.

**AWS Lambda**

* It is a serverless compute service. It is also responsible for executing code for applications.
* It helps you execute a program without the hassle of managing servers.

**Storage**

AWS provides web data storage service for archiving data. Also, its primary advantage is disaster data recovery with high durability. 

**Amazon S3**

* It is an open cloud-based storage service that is utilized for online data backup.
* Amazon S3 provides storage through a web services interface and is designed for developers where web-scale computing can be easier for them. Click here, to know more.

**Amazon EBS**

* It provides a high availability storage volume for persistent data. It is mainly used by Amazon EC2 instances.
* EBS volumes are used explicitly for primary storage such as file storage, databases storage, and block-level storage.

**Database**

AWS database domain service offers cost-efficient, highly secure, and scalable database instances in the cloud.
DynamoDB

* It is a flexible NoSQL database service that offers fast and reliable performance with no scalability issues.
* It is a multi-region and durable database with instant built-in security, backup and restores features.

**RDS**

* It is a managed distributed relational database cloud service that helps developers to operate and scale a database in a simple manner.
* We launched it to simplify the setup, operation, and scaling process for developers while accessing a relational database.
Networking and Delivery of Content

It offers a highly secure cloud platform and connects your physical network to your private VN with a high transfer speed.

**VPC**

* It helps a developer to deploy AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances into a private virtual cloud.
* It gives you control over the complete cloud network environment, including the section of your IP address range, subnets, route table configuration, and network gateways.
* With this, developers can both IPv4 and IPv6 at a time for your resources in a highly secure environment.

**Route 53**

* It is a web service with a highly available Domain Name System (DNS) that helps users to route software by translating the text into an IP address.
* We launched it for developers to provide them a cost-effective method of routing end users to cloud applications. 

**Developer Tools**

It helps a user build, deploy, and run an application source code automatically. It also updates the server and instance on the workload.

**CodeStar**

It is a service designed to manage application development in a single place. Here, developers can quickly develop, build and deploy applications on AWS
**Code Build**

* This removes the hassle of managing physical servers and helps developers build and test code with continuous scaling.
* In simple words, it compiles your code, executes unit tests, and gives output artifacts that are ready to deploy.

## Security, Identity & Compliance

It helps in monitoring a safe environment for your AWS resources by providing limited access to specific users.

**IAM**

IAM is an AWS service which sets the permissions in order to allocate right resources to the right persons at the right time
* It allows access to compute, storage, database and application services.
* It deals with 3 terms such as **users**, **group** and **permissions**.
* It creates and manages AWS users and groups, also it provides permission to **allow** and **deny** access to AWS resources
* Identity Access Management is a framework that helps in maintaining access to AWS services in a secure way.
* The service gives you Shared access to your AWS account and Secure access to AWS services that run on the AWS EC2 application. 

**KMS**

 * It enables users to create and manage the encryption keys that are used for encrypting data.
