# CodeCommit
### What is CodeCommit ?
CodeCommit is a managed source control service by AWS that allows users to store, manage, and version their source code and artifacts securely and at scale. It supports Git, integrates with other AWS services, enables collaboration through branch and merge workflows, and provides audit logs and compliance reports to meet regulatory requirements and track changes. Overall, CodeCommit provides developers with a reliable and efficient way to manage their codebase and set up a CI/CD pipeline for their software development projects.

AWS CodeCommit is a version control service hosted by Amazon  Web Services (AWS) that you can use to privately store and manage assets such as documents, source code, and binary files. It is an in-house repository or infrastructure that lets you host or hold repositories. AWS CodeCommit basically gives you an environment where you can actually go ahead commit your code, code push it, or pull it.

AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that hosts your secure Git-based repositories. It makes it easy for groups to collaborate on code in a secure and highly scalable ecosystem. CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate your source control system or worry about scaling its infrastructure. CodeCommit securely stores anything from source code to binaries, and it runs seamlessly with your existing Git tools.

### Benefits Of AWS CodeCommit
**Store any type of Code**: AWS CodeCommit lets you store any type of code as there are very fewer restrictions on the type and the extensions of the code that you store.

**Fully Managed**:  AWS CodeCommit eliminates the need to host, maintain, back up, and scale your own source control servers. The service automatically scales to meet the growing needs of your project.

**Highly Secure**: Security is something which you donâ€™t need to worry about with AWS Code Commit., like the code, you push or pull is encrypted. CodeCommit is integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) allowing you to customize user-specific access to your repositories.

**Ensures Collaborative Work**: AWS CodeCommit helps you collaborate on code with teammates via pull requests, branching and merging, and you can give proper access to people who can access this piece of code, make changes to it and under different IAM users and under different security groups this process becomes very much engaging and collaborative.
Faster development lifecycle: AWS CodeCommit keeps your repositories close to your build, staging, and production environments in the AWS cloud. You can transfer incremental changes instead of the entire application. This allows you to increase the speed and frequency of your development lifecycle.

**Scale Easily**: When you talk about cloud platforms and any service, it ensures scalability so does the amount of code you push on this particular service.

**Integrate with third-party tools**: The best thing about AWS CodeCommit is that it places your code in such locations that it becomes very easy to integrate with your third-party tools. You can keep using your preferred development environment plugins, continuous integration/continuous delivery systems, and graphical clients with CodeCommit.
