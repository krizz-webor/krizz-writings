## What is CodePipeline

AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipeline. It allows users to build, test and deploy code into a test or production environment using either the AWS CLI or a clean UI configuration process within the Amazon Console.

CodePipeline builds, tests, and deploys your code every time there is a code change, based on the release process models you define. Think of it as a CI/CD Pipeline service
