## How to deploy a Node.js application in GitHub to Azure Container Registry using Azure DevOps

**Set up a GitHub repository**:

Make sure you have a GitHub repository set up for your Node.js application. You should have your application code committed to this repository.

**Create a new Azure DevOps project**:

Azure DevOps is a cloud-based service that provides tools for software development, including version control, continuous integration and delivery, and project management. 

To use Azure DevOps, you need to create a project that will contain your pipelines, repositories, and other resources.

To create a new Azure DevOps project, go to the Azure DevOps portal and click on `New Project`.

You will be prompted to provide a name and a description for your project, as well as to select a visibility level (public or private). 

Once you have created your project, you can start creating pipelines.

**Create a new Azure DevOps pipeline**:

A pipeline in Azure DevOps is a series of steps that automate the build, testing, and deployment of your code. 

To create a new pipeline, go to your Azure DevOps project and click on `Pipelines` in the left-hand menu. Then click on `New Pipeline`.

When you create a new pipeline, you will be asked to select a source for your code.

Choose `GitHub` and follow the prompts to connect your GitHub account and select your repository.

**Connect your GitHub repository to your Azure DevOps pipeline**

Once you have created your pipeline, you need to connect it to your GitHub repository.

This allows Azure DevOps to access your code and run the pipeline whenever changes are made to your code.

To connect your GitHub repository to your Azure DevOps pipeline, follow the prompts provided in the pipeline creation wizard.

You will be asked to authorize Azure DevOps to access your GitHub account and select the repository you want to use.

**Configure your pipeline**

Once your pipeline is connected to your GitHub repository, you can configure it to build and deploy your Node.js application to Azure Container Registry. 

This involves creating a pipeline script that defines the steps to be performed, such as installing dependencies, building your code, and deploying your application to Azure Container Registry.

    trigger:
    - main
    variables:
      azureSubscription: '<name of your Azure subscription>'
      azureContainerRegistry: '<name of your Azure Container Registry>'
      azureResourceGroup: '<name of your Azure resource group>'
      imageName: '<name of your Docker image>'
      tag: '$(Build.BuildId)'
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - task: NodeTool@0
      inputs:
        versionSpec: '10.x'
      displayName: 'Install Node.js'
    - task: Docker@2
      inputs:
        command: 'buildAndPush'
        containerRegistry: '$(azureContainerRegistry)'
        repository: '$(imageName)'
        tags: |
          $(tag)
      displayName: 'Build and push Docker image'
    - task: AzureCLI@2
      inputs:
        azureSubscription: '$(azureSubscription)'
        scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
        inlineScript: |
          az acr repository show-tags --name $(azureContainerRegistry) --repository $(imageName) --output table
          az container create --resource-group $(azureResourceGroup) --name $(imageName) --image $(azureContainerRegistry).azurecr.io/$(imageName):$(tag) --cpu 1 --memory 1.5 --registry-login-server $(azureContainerRegistry).azurecr.io --registry-username $(azureContainerRegistry) --registry-password $(acrPassword) --ports 80
      env:
        acrPassword: $(azureContainerRegistryPassword)
      displayName: 'Create Azure Container Instance'

The pipeline script is written in `YAML` format and can be created using the visual designer in Azure DevOps or by editing the YAML directly. 

In addition to the pipeline script, you also need to configure pipeline variables and secrets that provide information such as your Azure subscription, the name of your Azure Container Registry, and the password for your registry. 

These variables and secrets can be added to your pipeline settings in the Azure DevOps portal.
