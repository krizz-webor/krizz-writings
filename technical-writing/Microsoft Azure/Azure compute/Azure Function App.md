# Azure Function App
Azure Functions is a solution for easyily running small piece of code or functions in the cloud.
You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about the whole application or the infrastructure to run it. 
## Trigger
A trigger is an action that will involve the code and will pass some basic information to the code in order to run. 
## Consumption Plan
This is this serverless plan which means that you don't manage any servers. Azure will give you servers whenever there's a proccessing happening, whenever there's not, it will take away those servers. So you have between 0 and 200 servers available.
