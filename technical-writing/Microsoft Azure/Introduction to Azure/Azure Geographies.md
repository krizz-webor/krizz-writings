## Why are Azure Geographies important
Well, regulated data like financial, health care or credit data may not be allowed to leave the country. Legally your organisation is required to store such data in the same country where the operations are being carried out. So, if you select a geography like India for example, Azure ensures your data is not stored outside of India. Similarly if you select United States, the data stays inside the states. You have complete control on which geographies you want your data and applications to be deployed. You can be assured, Microsoft will not store customer data outside the geography you specify, except for certain non-regional services.

In simple terms, an Azure geography is an area of the world that contains one or more Azure regions. Azure region is a very important concept because every time you create an azure resource like a virtual machine for example, you need to specify the region where you want the resource, in this case, the virtual machine to be created. An azure region may also be paired-up with another azure region and there are several benefits of this paring. An azure region may also have availability zones.
