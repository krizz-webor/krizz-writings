## Cloud computing
### What is cloud computing?
Simply put, cloud computing is a way of accessing services on the internet instead of on your computer. You can use the cloud to access applications, data, and development tools from virtually anywhere. Whether you’re working on your phone from a crowded place or on your laptop at a hotel, you can access the same information because it all lives online.

Cloud Computing is a network of remote servers hosted on the internet for storing and retrieving data. The cloud provides a number of IT services such as servers, databases, software, virtual storage, and networking, among others. Companies that offer all the services are called cloud providers. They provide you with the ability to store and retrieve data and run applications, managing them through configuration portals. Two of the best cloud providers available today are Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
## Who uses cloud computing?
The short answer is: everyone. From your phone and your car to your smart watch, the cloud is everywhere.

But cloud computing is especially powerful for businesses. Because it gives them flexibility and scalability, organizations of every size and in every industry already use cloud computing. Companies use it for routine tasks like data protection, software development, data analytics, disaster recovery, virtual desktops, server virtualization, and customer-facing applications.
### Cloud computing services models
1. IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)
2. PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)
3. SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
#### IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)
IaaS provides on-demand access to fundamental computing resources–physical and virtual servers, networking, and storage—over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS enables end users to scale and shrink resources on an as-needed basis, reducing the need for high, up-front capital expenditures or unnecessary on-premises or ‘owned’ infrastructure and for overbuying resources to accommodate periodic spikes in usage.
#### IaaS characteristics.
IaaS is scalable and offers businesses greater flexibility than on-premise solutions through the cloud. IaaS businesses typically provide services such as pay-as-you-go storage, networking and virtualization.

IaaS cloud servers are typically offered to businesses over the internet, whether through a dashboard or an API(Application Programming Interface), ensuring users have complete control over their computing infrastructure.

IaaS platforms are:

* Highly flexible and highly scalable.
* Accessible by multiple users.
* Cost-effective.

A good example of IaaS is **AWS EC2**.
EC2 delivers scalable infrastructure for companies that want to host cloud-based applications. EC2 users do not own the physical servers — AWS provides virtual servers.

Users only pay for the usage of the servers, saving them the cost — and associated ongoing maintenance — of investing in physical hardware.
#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS provides software developers with on-demand platform—hardware, complete software stack, infrastructure, and even development tools—for running, developing, and managing applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility of maintaining that platform on-premises.

With PaaS, the cloud provider hosts everything—servers, networks, storage, operating system software, middleware, databases—at their data center. Developers simply pick from a menu to ‘spin up’ servers and environments they need to run, build, test, deploy, maintain, update, and scale applications.
Today, PaaS is often built around containers, a virtualized compute model one step removed from virtual servers. Containers virtualize the operating system, enabling developers to package the application with only the operating system services it needs to run on any platform, without modification and without need for middleware.

**Red Hat OpenShift** is a popular PaaS built around Docker containers and Kubernetes, an open source container orchestration solution that automates deployment, scaling, load balancing, and more for container-based applications.

PaaS platforms are:
* Accessible by multiple users.
* Scalable — customers can choose from various tiers of computing resources to suit the size of their business.
* Built on virtualization technology.
* Easy to run without extensive system administration knowledge.

PaaS is primarily used by developers who are building software or applications.

A PaaS solution provides the platform for developers to create unique, customizable software meaning that developers don’t need to start from scratch when developing applications — saving them time and money on writing extensive code.

PaaS is a popular choice for businesses who want to create unique applications without spending a fortune or taking on all the responsibility. It’s similar to the difference between hiring a venue to put on a show vs. building one yourself to put on a show.

A good example of PaaS is **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers over 200 cloud computing services such as EC2, RDS, and S3. Most of these services can be used as IaaS, and most companies who use AWS will pick and choose the services they need.

However, managing multiple services can quickly become difficult and time-consuming for users. 

That’s where AWS Elastic Beanstalk comes in. It works as another layer on top of the infrastructure services and automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scalability, and application health monitoring.
#### SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
SAAS is an acronym for Service As A Software. Out of all the cloud services, it is the most prevalent one- allowing its users to run existing online apps. SaaS provides various software like word processing, email, design software, collaboration software, and other application hosts. One can access these SaaS applications directly through web browsers- eliminating the need to install any application on a person’s workstation.

A SaaS vendor manages operating systems, servers, data, applications, storage, and many more. Thus, an IT manager only needs to worry about software usage and employee access to it. SaaS works as a model software- deployed in the form of hosting service that anyone can access (in the form of Output Re-written / Rephrased Text) via the internet or by using a software delivery model.

The SaaS hosts its clients’ software and the associated data centrally. So, the clients can access them using an online browser via the web. The SaaS services assist in the deployment and development of modern apps. A few examples of SaaS services include Google G Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, etc.

In addition to the cost savings, time-to-value, and scalability benefits of cloud, SaaS offers the following:

* Automatic upgrades: With SaaS, you take advantage of new features as soon as the provider adds them, without having to orchestrate an on-premises upgrade.
* Protection from data loss: Because your application data is in the cloud, with the application, you don’t lose data if your device crashes or breaks.

SaaS is the primary delivery model for most commercial software today—there are hundreds of thousands of SaaS solutions available, from the most focused industry and departmental applications, to powerful enterprise software database and AI (artificial intelligence) software.
#### SaaS characteristics.
SaaS is delivered through the internet as a full functional service, accessible via any web browser. With SaaS, vendors manage the data, servers and storage, ultimately eliminating the need for IT review and streamlining business processes.

SaaS platforms are:
* Available over the Internet.
Hosted on a remote server by a third-party provider.
* Ideal for small businesses or startups who cannot develop their own software applications.
* Scalable, with different tiers for small, medium and enterprise-level businesses.
* Inclusive, offering security, compliance and maintenance as part of the cost.

## Types of cloud computing
**Public cloud**:
Public cloud is a type of cloud computing in which a cloud service provider makes computing resources—anything from SaaS applications, to individual virtual machines (VMs), to bare metal computing hardware, to complete enterprise-grade infrastructures and development platforms—available to users over the public internet. These resources might be accessible for free, or access might be sold according to subscription-based or pay-per-usage pricing models.

The public cloud provider owns, manages, and assumes all responsibility for the data centers, hardware, and infrastructure on which its customers’ workloads run, and it typically provides high-bandwidth network connectivity to ensure high performance and rapid access to applications and data.

Third-party cloud vendors own and manage public clouds for use by the general public. They own all the hardware, software, and infrastructure that constitute the cloud. Their customers own the data and applications that live on the cloud.

**Private cloud**:
Private cloud is a cloud environment in which all cloud infrastructure and computing resources are dedicated to, and accessible by, one customer only. Private cloud combines many of the benefits of cloud computing—including elasticity, scalability, and ease of service delivery—with the access control, security, and resource customization of on-premises infrastructure.

A private cloud is typically hosted on-premises in the customer's data center. But a private cloud can also be hosted on an independent cloud provider’s infrastructure or built on rented infrastructure housed in an offsite data center.

From corporations to universities, organizations can host private clouds (also known as corporate clouds, internal clouds, and on-premise clouds) for their exclusive use. When they do, they own the cloud’s underlying infrastructure and host it either onsite or at a remote location.

**Hybrid cloud**:
Hybrid cloud is just what it sounds like—a combination of public and private cloud environments. Specifically, and ideally, a hybrid cloud connects an organization's private cloud services and public clouds into a single, flexible infrastructure for running the organization’s applications and workloads.

The goal of hybrid cloud is to establish a mix of public and private cloud resources—and with a level of orchestration between them—that gives an organization the flexibility to choose the optimal cloud for each application or workload and to move workloads freely between the two clouds as circumstances change. This enables the organization to meet its technical and business objectives more effectively and cost-efficiently than it could with public or private cloud alone.

Hybrid clouds fuse private clouds with public clouds for the best of both worlds. Generally, organizations use private clouds for critical or sensitive functions and public clouds to accommodate surges in computing demand. Data and applications often flow automatically between them. This gives organizations increased flexibility without requiring them to abandon existing infrastructure, compliance, and security.

**Multicloud**:
Multicloud is the use of two or more clouds from two or more different cloud providers. Having a multicloud environment can be as simple using email SaaS from one vendor and image editing SaaS from another. But when enterprises talk about multicloud, they're typically talking about using multiple cloud services—including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services—from two or more of the leading public cloud providers. In one survey, 85% of organizations reported using multicloud environments.

**Hybrid multicloud**:
Is the use of two or more public clouds together with a private cloud environment. 

Organizations choose multicloud to avoid vendor lock-in, to have more services to choose from, and to access to more innovation. But the more clouds you use—each with its own set of management tools, data transmission rates, and security protocols—the more difficult it can be to manage your environment. Multicloud management platforms provide visibility across multiple provider clouds through a central dashboard, where development teams can see their projects and deployments, operations teams can keep an eye on clusters and nodes, and the cybersecurity staff can monitor for threats.
